  This sandbox is to be considered only an experimental, unsupported example of
  how the DDS1 components might be implemented within an Angular application.

  Please remember that this sample Angular app is not actually supported, while
  at the same time is used in creating sample code that helps answer questions
  and solve issues with the core and vanilla DDS1 library.

<h3 class="boxH3">Notes</h3>
<h4 class="boxH4">Shell Inheritance</h4>
<p>
  All wrapping components inherit from
  <i>lib/helpers/dds.component.ts</i>; This base component includes default
  inputs such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    elementId (optional) - If left unsupplied, a random ID will be used instead.
    This is applied to the base element of the DDS component and similar IDs are
    generated for all linked/child components.
  </li>
  <li>
    init: "now" | "later" | "manual" = "now"; Instructs the shell component to
    initialize during AfterViewInit (now), or at some point via mutationObserver
    (later), or manually from the parent component (manual) by calling its
    method, initializeNow()
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="boxH4">Initialization Timing</h4>
<p>
  The component shell normally initializes the DDS component within the
  AfterViewInit life cycle stage. However if you add the
  <i>init</i> property to any of the components' instances, it will initialize
  AFTER that step, whenever the DDS component is found in the DOM.
